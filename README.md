# Pygame_Car_Dash
This project utilizes the Python package Pygame to create a car dashboard. The dashboard includes a speedometer, an RPM gauge, a timer for the current lap, a display of the past lap time, and a display for the best lap time.

This dashboard is meant to be used for a racing car, hence why it includes information about lap times. Feel free to modify the dashboard to fit your and your car's needs.

In this program, the variables listed under "car states" are the values you are reading from the car and displaying in some form on the dashboard. Currently, the "car state" variables are all set to 0. When you customize this program, change the "car states" to whatever values you are reading from your vehicle.
